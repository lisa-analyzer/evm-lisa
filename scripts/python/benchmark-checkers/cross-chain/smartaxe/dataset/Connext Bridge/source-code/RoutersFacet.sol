/**
 * @notice
 * This contract is designed to manage router access, meaning it maintains the
 * router recipients, owners, and the router allowlist itself.
 *
 * As a router, there are three important permissions:
 * `router` - this is the address that will sign bids sent to the sequencer
 * `routerRecipient` - this is the address that receives funds when liquidity is withdrawn
 * `routerOwner` - this is the address permitted to update recipients and propose new owners
 *
 * In cases where the owner is not set, the caller should be the `router` itself. In cases where the
 * `routerRecipient` is not set, the funds can be removed to anywhere.
 *
 * When setting a new `routerOwner`, the current owner (or router) must create a proposal, which
 * can be accepted by the proposed owner after the delay period. If the proposed owner is the empty
 * address, then it must be accepted by the current owner.
