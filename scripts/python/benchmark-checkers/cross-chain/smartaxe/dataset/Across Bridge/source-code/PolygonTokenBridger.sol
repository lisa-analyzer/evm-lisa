/**
 * @notice Contract deployed on Ethereum and Polygon to facilitate token transfers from Polygon to the HubPool and back.
 * @dev Because Polygon only allows withdrawals from a particular address to go to that same address on mainnet, we need to
 * have some sort of contract that can guarantee identical addresses on Polygon and Ethereum. This contract is intended
 * to be completely immutable, so it's guaranteed that the contract on each side is  configured identically as long as
 * it is created via create2. create2 is an alternative creation method that uses a different address determination
 * mechanism from normal create.
 * Normal create: address = hash(deployer_address, deployer_nonce)
 * create2:       address = hash(0xFF, sender, salt, bytecode)
 *  This ultimately allows create2 to generate deterministic addresses that don't depend on the transaction count of the
 * sender.
